# Udacity-Seattle Airbnb
Project 1 for Udacity Data Science NanoDegree

# Motivation For the Project
The project focuses on the analysis of Airbnb data for the city of Seattle, 2016. 

With this investigation I hope to draw some conclutions that might help the decision of invest or not invest in an Airbnb property in Seattle. To support this purpose and to guide the course of the analysis, the following questions were addressed:

**Q1.** What is the price and availability trend over time?

**Q2.** How can we characterize the type of properties that exist in seattle? And how those features relate to the price?

**Q3.** Which are the most popular neighborhoods in Seattle?

**Q4.** Is a strict cancellation policy bad for the business?

**Q5.** Predicting Pricing - in which features should bet to make the most out of my airbnb?  

# Libraries Used
To run the project you need to install the following libraries:
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * datetime
  * Sklearn
  
# File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase the work related to the above questions. The notebook starts with an exploratory analysis of the datasets, followed by the cleaning and processing phase. Then, each of the search questions ware addressed. Finally, the modeling phase and final conclusions. 
Markdown cells were used to comment the mais results and conclusions along the process. 

# Summary of the Results of the Analysis
